import CalloutInfo from '../../components/CalloutInfo.astro'

## Installation
Use Composer to install the package as a developer dependency:

```bash
composer require --dev lucatume/wp-browser
```

## Configuration
Initialize the project:

```bash
vendor/bin/codecept init wpbrowser
```

The command will detect the type of project you are working on, either a plugin, a theme or a WordPress
installation, and will guide you with few questions to set up the configuration file.

By default, the configuration process will create three test suites:

* `Integration` - test your code integration with WordPress installation, striking
a good balance between fine execution speed and coverage. This suite runs the same kind of tests you would run using
the [WordPress PHPUnit test suite][5] or you would scaffold using the [`wp scaffold plugin-tests`][6] command.
* `EndToEnd` - test your code as a user would, using a real browser will full Javascript support. This suite is slower
to execute but will give you a better idea of how your code behaves at a higher level.

Once the configuration process is complete you can run the tests using the `run:all` command.

```bash
vendor/bin/codecept run:all
```

The command scaffolded a couple example tests for you to get started with in each suite, if everything is configured
correctly you should see the tests passing.

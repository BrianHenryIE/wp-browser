# Sponsors

I maintain the wp-browser project while working full-time as a freelance and dedicating my spare time to it.
I do it with passion and for "love of the craft," but it can become a chore at times.

Appreciation, the most common form of support, goes a long way but does not pay the bills.  
I want to dedicate more structured time to the project, and that would mean turning down some freelance work offers.
To that end, I've [applied for GitHub sponsorship system](https://github.com/sponsors/lucatume).

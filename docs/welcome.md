The [wp-browser project](https://github.com/lucatume/wp-browser "lucatume/wp-browser Â· GitHub") provides a [Codeception](http://codeception.com/ "Codeception - BDD-style PHP testing.") based solution to test WordPress plugins, themes and whole sites at all levels of testing.  
The purpose of this documentation is to help you set up, run and iterate over your project and test code using the powerfule APIs provided by Codeception while trying to alleviate the pains of setting it up for WordPress projects.  
Throughout the documentation you will find references to test terminology: I've tried to condense those into small, digestable chunks to provide a rough idea without and a limited context; where required I tried to provide links to dive deeper into the subjects.  

Happy testing!
